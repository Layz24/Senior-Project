About the Computer Science Program
The Computer Science Program provides students with fundamental computer science knowledge and training, and prepares them to apply their knowledge and training to produce solutions to specific problems. Students learn to define a problem clearly, determine its feasibility and choose an appropriate solution strategy. The solution strategy will study, specify, design, implement, test, modify, and document the solution. As part of the solution strategy, students will learn to evaluate alternative designs, perform risk analysis on alternative designs, and finally, communicate solutions to colleagues and other professionals. A key element to all of this is the ability of the student to work and collaborate within a team environment throughout the entire problem-solving process.
Primary Objective of the Computer Science Curriculum
Provide practical knowledge that will be of immediate use in the profession.
Provide a solid foundation in theoretical computer science, so that graduates will have the fundamentals necessary to acquire knowledge in a rapidly evolving discipline.
Bachelor of Computer Science degree students learning outcomes
Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline.
Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.
Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.
Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program discipline.
Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions.
Areas of Learning Focus
Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Cryptography, Data Science, Game/Robotics, Quantum Computing, Cloud Computing. 
The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Computer Science
The undergraduate program in Computer Science prepares students for entry into the computing profession, for graduate study in computer, computational, and data sciences, and for the many challenges that will confront them in their professional and personal life. The Computer Science program also prepares students to apply their knowledge and training to produce solutions to specific and esoteric problems. Students learn to define the problem clearly; to determine its tractability; to determine when consultation with outside experts is appropriate; to evaluate and choose an appropriate solution strategy; and then to study, specify, design, implement, test, modify, and document that solution; to evaluate alternatives and perform risk analysis on that design; to integrate alternative techniques and technologies into that solution; and finally to communicate that solution to colleagues, to professionals in other fields, and to the general public. Key to all of this is the ability of the problem-solver to work within a team environment throughout the entire problem-solving process.

Office of the Bursar - Morgan State University
Contact Information:
Location: Tyler Hall, 1700 East Cold Spring Lane, Baltimore, MD 21251
Phone: 443-885-3108
Email: bursar@morgan.edu
The Bursar’s office is responsible for billing, tuition, and student account services. Students are encouraged to contact them for help with payments, payment plans, refunds, and general account inquiries.
Payments:
Accepted Payment Methods:
In-Person Payments: Students can pay with cash, certified checks, cashier’s checks, or money orders. Personal checks are accepted, but if returned for insufficient funds, students will be charged fees.
Online Payments: Credit and debit cards (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express) are accepted. Students can also pay through WebSIS for convenience.
Mail Payments: Money orders or certified checks can be sent by mail. Personal checks are accepted, but a returned check fee applies.
Returned Payments: If a payment is returned due to insufficient funds, students will be charged a penalty and may lose check-writing privileges at the university.
Payment Plans:
Interest-Free Payment Plan: Morgan State offers students the option to enroll in interest-free monthly payment plans through CASHNet. These plans allow students to pay their tuition and fees in 3 or 4 equal monthly installments, helping to spread out the cost.
Enrollment Requirements: Students must enroll in the payment plan before the due date of the first installment.
Available for Fall and Spring Semesters: The payment plan is available for both fall and spring semesters, providing flexibility for tuition payments.
Refund Information:
Refunds are processed when there is a credit balance on the student’s account, typically due to overpayment or adjustments in financial aid. The refund will be issued via BankMobile, which partners with the university to distribute refunds to students.
Timing: Refunds are issued only after the add/drop period ends, ensuring that all adjustments to the student’s schedule are finalized. Delays may occur if financial aid adjustments are made.
Refund Options: Students can choose between direct deposit into a personal account or receiving a paper check.
Important Note: Federal, state, or institutional aid changes could affect the refund amount, resulting in a potential reduction or increase in the credit balance.
Perkins Loans:
Perkins Loans Overview: Although no longer issued, Perkins Loans were low-interest federal loans for students with financial need. Existing borrowers can still receive assistance for repayment, deferment, and cancellation.
Repayment: Students must begin repaying their Perkins Loan after a nine-month grace period. Payments are managed through Heartland ECSI, a loan servicer.
Deferment and Cancellation: Borrowers can apply for deferment if they are continuing education, unemployed, or in the military. Loan cancellation is available for those in specific careers, such as teaching in low-income schools or serving in the military.
Tax Information:
1098-T Tax Form: The university issues the 1098-T form annually by January 31. This form helps students claim education tax credits, such as the Lifetime Learning Credit or American Opportunity Credit, which can reduce the amount of federal taxes owed.
Accessing the 1098-T Form: Students can access their 1098-T form online through WebSIS or request it by contacting the Bursar’s Office. It's important for students to keep track of this document for tax filings.

The Counseling Center is the primary mental health service provider on campus, offering confidential and short-term psychological services. These services address personal, academic, and career concerns. Both in-person and virtual appointments are available.
Services Provided:
Individual Counseling:
Available to any currently registered student. Students can discuss issues such as anxiety, depression, relational concerns, and stress. Virtual appointments are also available after the initial intake.
Group Counseling:
Offers a supportive environment where students with similar concerns can communicate and grow together. Groups are available on topics like social anxiety, grief, and self-esteem.
Couples Counseling:
Helps partners (at least one of whom must be a registered student) build healthier relationships by improving communication and understanding.
Crisis Response:
If a student is experiencing a mental health crisis, such as self-harm risk or psychosis, the Counseling Center offers immediate support. During business hours, a provider is available for consultation, and after hours, Campus Safety can be contacted at 443-885-3103.
Consultation:
Faculty, staff, and parents can consult with the Counseling Center about students of concern, helping to connect them with appropriate services or providing mental health advice.
Outreach Programs:
Workshops and educational programs are available to the campus community to raise awareness about mental health and reduce stigma.
Referral to Off-Campus Providers:
If a student requires long-term care or specialized treatment, the Counseling Center can refer them to off-campus providers.
What to Expect During Your First Visit:
Your first session is called an intake session, where you will discuss your reasons for seeking counseling and complete required forms. The provider will then help determine the best course of action for your needs.
